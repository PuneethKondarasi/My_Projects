        <h2>What is Syllabus Scout?</h2>
        <p>
          Syllabus Scout is a web application that allows students to search for
          study materials for a given topic or syllabus. This can be useful for
          students who are looking to get a head start on their classes by
          providing them with all the study materials that they require in a
          single place.

      <div class="info2">
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
          Students can search for study material by entering the name of the
          topic or by uploading the syllabus. The application will then return a
          list of study materials that match the search criteria. Students can
          then click on the material to view it.

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          At Syllabus Scout, we believe that education should be accessible to
          everyone, everywhere. That's why we've created a platform dedicated to
          providing high-quality study materials to students around the globe.
          The idea for Syllabus Scout was born during a one-day ideathon at VIT
          Vellore, where a group of passionate individuals came together with a
          shared vision: to make education accessible to everyone, everywhere.
          Inspired by this vision, we set out to create a platform dedicated to
          providing high-quality study materials to students. Whether you're a
          student preparing for exams, a teacher looking for supplemental
          materials, or a lifelong learner eager to expand your knowledge, we're
          here to support you every step of the way. With a vast library of
          study materials covering a wide range of subjects and topics, our
          platform offers something for everyone. What sets us apart is our
          dedication to quality, accessibility, and affordability. We work
          tirelessly to ensure that our study materials are accurate,
          up-to-date, and easy to understand. And with flexible pricing plans
          and special discounts for students and educators, we strive to make
          our platform accessible to learners of all budgets. But our commitment
          to education goes beyond just providing study materials.Through
          forums, discussion boards, and virtual events, we aim to create a
          supportive environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to
          learn. Thank you for choosing Syllabus Scout as your trusted partner
          in education. We're excited to embark on this journey with you and
          help you unlock your full potential. Together, we can shape a brighter
          future through the power of learning.
