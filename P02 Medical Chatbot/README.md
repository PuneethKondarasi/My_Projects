## ‚ú® Features

- **Medical Knowledge Base**: Powered by The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for intelligent responses
- **Vector Search**: FAISS-based similarity search for relevant medical information
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful Streamlit interface with chat-like experience
- **Context-Aware**: Only responds to medically relevant questions

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this project, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system
- **Google AI Studio API Key** - Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- **Medical PDF Data** - The project includes The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine PDF

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd "P02 Medical Chatbot"
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

### 2. Initialize the Vector Database

Run the data processing script to create the vector database from your medical PDF:

```bash
python create_memory_for_llm.py
```

This script will:
- Load the PDF from `data/The_GALE_ENCYCLOPEDIA_of_MEDICINE_SECOND.pdf`
- Split the content into manageable chunks
- Create vector embeddings using HuggingFace
- Store the vectors in a FAISS database at `vectorstore/db_faiss`

## üéØ Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
streamlit run medibot.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the Chatbot

1. **Ask Medical Questions**: Type your medical question in the chat input
2. **Get Informed Responses**: The AI will provide evidence-based medical information
3. **View Sources**: Each response includes source references from the medical encyclopedia
4. **Monitor Status**: Check the sidebar for system status and API key configuration

### Example Questions

- "What are the symptoms of diabetes?"
- "How does methotrexate work?"
- "What is hypertension?"
