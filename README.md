1. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install imaplib email
     ```

2. **Run the Scripts**:

   - Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
   - Execute each script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python <script_name>.py
     ```

3. **Configuration**:

   - Ensure you have access to an IMAP-enabled email account (like Gmail, Yahoo, etc.).
   - Modify the script configuration where necessary to set your email server, username, password, and other required details.

   Example usage in `p2_to_access_mails.py`:

   ```python
   
   imap = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL("imap.gmail.com")
   username = "your_email@gmail.com"  # Replace with your Gmail account
